Sample frequency = 142857.142857 Hz

raw_data.txt contains 40 sets of 55000 samples each.
data.txt should contain the identical data, but does not. Not sure why, I must have messed something up while saving it.

This data does contain some non-continuous sections where the signal passed below 0V. This is an artifact of my setup. The real circuit should keep the waveform centered at 0.9V.
