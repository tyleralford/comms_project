Sample frequency = 142857.142857 Hz

Tone #1 = 332Hz

Tone #2 = 1236Hz


Each file contains 40 sets of 55000 samples each.


This data does contain some non-continuous sections where the signal passed below 0V. This is an artifact of my setup. The real circuit should keep the waveform centered at 0.9V.
